"""Assert that every Taskfile poly skips is skipped for the reason we expect.

poly cannot format Taskfile YAML that contains Go template syntax (``{{ }}``)
and skips those files. That is correct behavior — the files genuinely are not
parseable as plain YAML — but it means most of our task automation is linted by
nothing. The danger is not the skip, it is that a *new* file can silently join
the skipped set and look identical to a file that was checked and found clean.

This check reads poly's ``--format json`` report, which names every file it
surveyed and, for each skip, the reason. So the assertion is made per file:

    every skipped file must carry the Go/Helm template skip reason,
    and every file in the scan set must appear in the report

Neither a count nor a list of expected filenames appears here. An earlier
version reconstructed the expected skip set from "the file contains ``{{``" and
compared counts; that broke the moment poly's YAML parser improved enough to
format the root ``Taskfile.yml`` in place — 17 expected, 16 reported — even
though coverage had strictly *increased*. Deriving the verdict from poly's own
per-file reason means the check tracks poly instead of predicting it: more
files getting linted is a pass, and a skip for any new reason is a failure that
names the file.

Retire this in favour of a poly flag (``--deny-skips`` / ``--max-skips=N``) if
one ships; it was requested upstream. This is a workaround for a missing
strict mode, not a thing worth keeping on its own merits.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ci/check_task_lint_coverage.py    # exit 1 on unexpected skips
